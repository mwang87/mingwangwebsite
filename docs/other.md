## Potato Surfer

I created potato surfer in 2014 with a couple of friends. We wanted to recreate the viewing experience of television on the internet with internet content. Users can view channels with none of the modern viewing amenities, such as pause and rewind. We've removed the tyranny of choice with users only able to change channel with everyone sync'd up. Additionally, users can also be channel producers: curating content and scheduling content display with full control of their own channel. At our peak we had thousands of users but have since shut it down.
