## A Cappella

During the 2011-2012 school year, I was a member and a director of a co-ed a cappella group ([Acamazing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8tzvu0mYhVS3QoyMXxguSA)) which I helped found in 2010. The following are performances during my tenure as director of which several pieces I arranged.
