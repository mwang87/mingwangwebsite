# About Me

I am a computer engineer/scientist/bioinformatician at UCSD. My research interests are in bioinformatics and more specifically, I focus on computational mass spectrometry. During my graduate studies, I had the honor of being advised by Nuno Bandeira PhD. Currently, I am pursuing my post-doctoral work with Pieter C. Dorrestein PhD in the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. 

Prior to coming to San Diego, I attended the University of Illinois for my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. However, it was in Missouri that I spent my most impressionable years.
